# LESSON 10:
# Summary and Proposal



Prior to this lesson, I had very little knowledge about what Search Engine
Optimization actually was. I knew a little bit about how websites can be tracked
and analyzed from a marketing perspective, but not much about how to help them
attract visitors. Much of the information in the course video was new for me.
I wasn't aware that being linked to from another site mattered, and it makes perfect
sense that you would want to be mindful of who does that since it can affect both
your score and your credibility with users. It was also helpful to know that
what content you place in your H1 tags is so important because Google uses them
as part of its analysis.

In addition to the video, I discovered some tips in the blog that was recommended: _Beginner's Guide to SEO_ on moz.com. I found the advice about how to choose the
best keywords for your site (creating a "keyword theme"), as well as how to include
them in some of your more prominent content, to be very useful. There are even
suggestions about how to conduct research for keyword selection –— such as trying
to determine what results are currently returned with certain keywords -– and
a mention of some resources to help you do that. I feel that this introduction to
SEO has helped me understand how different elements of a site can be used to
increase its visibility, and that SEO is something that can be considered during
the site creation process rather than at the end.

After reading that including keywords in your site's content (title tags, H1 tags,
sub-headers, page copy, etc.) helps your site get discovered in a search, I would
conduct keyword research before finalizing my copy. This way, I could determine
which words to work in and if there is other information I should be including to
better appeal to my audience, such as putting more emphasis on a particular bit of information or adding an FAQ page based on what questions users typically ask. I
would also do a bit of searching to learn what sort of content competing sites are
offering so that I can see how my site compares. When ready to publish the site,
I would decide what to use as my Key Performance Indicators so that I can measure
my progress. Since I'm not selling anything or offering a service, perhaps I would
use Google Analytics to track the amount of time users spend on my site and what
content is most viewed.
